Recently I came across  a scenario where I need to detect failed slices of all Datasets in Azure Data Factory, in my case I need to detect for last 3 months and the number of slices was around 600+, they failed due to validation error as the source data wasn’t present and after a number of re-try slices were marked as failed. 

In such cases its difficult to perform re-run from the  Portal as you need to right click on each slice and run it explicitly. 

Solution: I wrote a following PowerShell Script, this script will detect all failed slices in a given Azure Data Factory and re-run same with your consent.

You can use same script not only for failed slices but for any status, you just need to change the Dataset status in filtering of slices, shown in following script.

I am also planning to write a solution which will run as a service in a worker role and automatically detect failed slices in a given time and re-run same.

Question can be asked, that in ADF you already have re-run logic they why you need to go through the hassles of writing and running script.

Yes we do have but after x number of re-runs a slices is marked as failed and only way is to run is through portal or programmatically. 

So, here is my contribution to ADF Community.

Pre-requisite – Azure Resource Manager PowerShell (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azps-1-0-pre/)
